#Wikicode for Moodle 2.*
Wikicode is a module for Moodle 2.*. It is a collaborative source code editor for the C programming language. It implements several options as: Parser, Editor, Compiling, Chat, Version Control or Stats. All of them are embedded into the browser, allowing multiple users to develop the same code with a self-locking system. The code is shown to users in real time and the compilation is done from the server. This allows users to code collaboratively without having to install anything on your computer.
